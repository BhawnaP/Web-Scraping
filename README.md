# Web-Scraping
This is my first web-scrapping project where I scrapped the data from a government website which had a list of all the reports generated during a particular period of time.
Libraries used are- BeautifulSoup, Pandas, requests
The data was first fetched into a list and had lot many unwanted elements as well.
Later it was cleaned usinf 'for' loops and stored in different lists which were converted into 'Series' to form a dataframe.
At last, the refined and cleaned data was exported into excel format.

The final report does have some flaws and data isn't as clean, but then this was my first approach. :)

I have uploaded both, the working notebook and final report.
